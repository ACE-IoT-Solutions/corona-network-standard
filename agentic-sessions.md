# Agentic Sessions Log

## Session: 2025-05-03

**Goal:** Refine the Pydantic to RDF network mapping script.

**Summary:**

1.  **CLI Implementation:** Modified `main.py` to use the `click` library. Added a command-line option (`-o` / `--output-file`) to specify the output file path for the generated Turtle RDF. If no file is specified, the output defaults to stdout.
2.  **Linting:** Ran `ruff check --fix` on `main.py` to automatically correct linting errors and ensure code style consistency.
3.  **Interface Name Normalization:** Replaced forward slashes (`/`) with hyphens (`-`) in interface identifiers (e.g., `Sw1_Fa0/1` became `Sw1_Fa0-1`) within both the Python script (`main.py`) and the example Turtle output file (`demo-network.ttl`). This was done to prevent potential issues with URI generation and parsing in RDF tools.
4.  **Documentation Update:** Updated `README.md` to reflect the changes:
    *   Added `click` to the requirements.
    *   Included instructions on how to clone the repository and install dependencies.
    *   Updated the usage section to demonstrate the new CLI options for outputting to console or a file.
    *   Corrected the interface names in the example Turtle output snippet to use hyphens instead of slashes.

## Session 2: Adding SHACL Validation (2025-05-03)

**Goal:** Add SHACL validation capabilities to the `corona-network-standard` tool.

**Steps:**

1.  **Restructure Data Files:**
    *   Created `src/corona_network_standard/data/ontology` and `src/corona_network_standard/data/shapes` directories.
    *   Moved the existing ontology TTL file to `data/ontology/network-ontology.ttl`.
    *   Created an initial SHACL shapes file `data/shapes/network-shapes.ttl` based on the ontology.

2.  **Refactor `main.py`:**
    *   Introduced `click.group()` to manage multiple commands.
    *   Renamed the existing generation logic into a `generate` command.
    *   Added a new `validate` command.

3.  **Add Dependencies:**
    *   Added `pyshacl` to `pyproject.toml` for SHACL validation.
    *   Added `importlib-resources` for accessing package data.
    *   Corrected the `[dependency-groups]` section to `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.

4.  **Implement Validation Logic:**
    *   Added logic to the `validate` command to:
        *   Load the data graph provided as an argument.
        *   Load the SHACL shapes graph (either from a specified file or the packaged default).
        *   Optionally load the ontology graph for inference.
        *   Use `pyshacl.validate` to perform the validation.
        *   Report conformance status and validation results.
    *   Implemented a `get_resource_path` helper function using `importlib.resources` to reliably locate the packaged shapes and ontology files.

5.  **Debugging and Refinement:**
    *   **Pydantic Validation:** Debugged an issue where the Pydantic validator for `Iface` wasn't triggering correctly when aliases were used. Resolved by adding `model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)` to the `Iface` model.
    *   **SHACL Parsing:** Encountered errors with `pyshacl` parsing `sh:qualifiedValueShape` constraints using `$this`. Replaced these constraints in `network-shapes.ttl` with equivalent `sh:sparql` constraints.
    *   **Resource Loading:** Fixed issues in `get_resource_path` related to handling `Traversable` objects from `importlib.resources.files` and ensuring paths were resolved correctly.
    *   **Cleanup:** Removed the Pydantic validation test block from the `generate` command to avoid printing test output during normal generation.

**Outcome:**

The `corona-network-tool` now has two commands:
*   `generate`: Creates an example network RDF graph based on Pydantic models.
*   `validate`: Validates a given RDF data graph against the packaged SHACL shapes (`network-shapes.ttl`) and ontology (`network-ontology.ttl`), utilizing RDFS inference.

Both Pydantic model validation and SHACL graph validation are working correctly.
