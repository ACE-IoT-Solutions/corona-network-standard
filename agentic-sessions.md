## Session: 2025-05-03

**Goal:** Refine the Pydantic to RDF network mapping script.

**Summary:**

1.  **CLI Implementation:** Modified `main.py` to use the `click` library. Added a command-line option (`-o` / `--output-file`) to specify the output file path for the generated Turtle RDF. If no file is specified, the output defaults to stdout.
2.  **Linting:** Ran `ruff check --fix` on `main.py` to automatically correct linting errors and ensure code style consistency.
3.  **Interface Name Normalization:** Replaced forward slashes (`/`) with hyphens (`-`) in interface identifiers (e.g., `Sw1_Fa0/1` became `Sw1_Fa0-1`) within both the Python script (`main.py`) and the example Turtle output file (`demo-network.ttl`). This was done to prevent potential issues with URI generation and parsing in RDF tools.
4.  **Documentation Update:** Updated `README.md` to reflect the changes:
    *   Added `click` to the requirements.
    *   Included instructions on how to clone the repository and install dependencies.
    *   Updated the usage section to demonstrate the new CLI options for outputting to console or a file.
    *   Corrected the interface names in the example Turtle output snippet to use hyphens instead of slashes.
